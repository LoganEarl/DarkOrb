/*
    Overview of the work system

    There are types of work that can be done. If a given type of work needs attention, a work detail is 
    created for the work type. Targets are registered to that work detail. A portion of the worker pool
    will be dispatched to accomplish the work when convenient.

    There are multiple pools of workers, delineated by their body composition. Each work detail specifies
    which pools of workers have access to the work. 

    Work details are prioritized within their worker pools. Idle workers will be assigned to the detail
    with the highest priority. 

    When posting a work detail, it is preferred if the detail's target progress can be reasonably
    reached within a few hundred ticks. This keeps workers from getting stuck on a single job for too
    long.

    Work targets each have their own sub-priority. This is used when individual workers are choosing 
    a target. If none is provided workers will choose whichever is the closest for roads and walls,
    and choose from a preset build priority list for buildings and upgrder jobs
